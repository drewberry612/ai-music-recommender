# 🎧 Wavelength – Natural Language Music Recommendations

Wavelength is an AI-powered web app that generates tailored music recommendations from natural language prompts like:

> “Energetic indie tracks with summery vibes that help me focus.”

Built with Python, Streamlit, and the Last.fm API, the app interprets your intent and returns relevant songs — not just by genre or mood, but by *vibe*.
